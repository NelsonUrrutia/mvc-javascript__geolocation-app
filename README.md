# 🗺️📌 Geolocation workout app

### TL;DR
This project is based on the course The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! by Jonas Schmedtmann.

The only purpose of this project is practice what I learned in the Course. It is worth clarifying that it is not a commercial project, nor do I seek financial compensation. It is an educational project.

This APP only uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Leaflet as a third party library.

The APP will help you to save the information of your workouts and visualize the places you workout in a map.
You can choose two types of workouts: Cycling or Running. And save this data:

- Time
- Distance
- Candence (for running)
- Elevation Gain (for cycling)
- Also you can filter by type and properties (time or distance).

The App saves the data in the localStorage. This allows data persistence, if you close the browser and return to the app, the information still be there.
